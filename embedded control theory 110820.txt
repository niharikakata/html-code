SINCE HERE everyy instruction of a program has to operate on data.
the different ways in which a source oerand is denoted in an instruction are knoe=wn as addressing modes.
with resepective to data types the operant changes.
we have two types:- sequencial flow and control transfer instruction(jump/call)..

TYPES OF ADDRESING MODE:
A.regiter addressing
B.immediate addressing               group 1:addressing modes for register and immediate data
C.direct addressing
D.register indirect addressing
E,based addressing
F.indexed addressing                group2: addressing modes for memory data
G.based index addressing
H.string addressing
I.direct I/O port addressing          group3: addressing modes for i/o ports
J.indirect i/o port addressing
K.relative addressing                 group4: relative addressing mode
L.implied addressing..                 group5: implied addressing mode

B.IN immediate addressing mode ,an 8-buit or 16 bit data is specified as part of the instruction.
   
8086 microposser:it is a 40 pin ic and conist only processing unit.
PIN AND SIGNALS:::
totoal pin divided into 3 types.
1 .common functions(signals)
2. mimimum mode signals [PROCESSER OPERATE IN SINGLE MODE THAT IS MIMIMUM MODE OF OPERATTION]
3.maximum mode signals.  [MULTI PROCESSOR MODE]
except[24-31]remaing are belog to common signals.
AD0-AD12 are adress and data bus.[they bhoth are time multiplear signal].
while performing it ascess first adress and than data ..(in first clock pluse)
A16/S3,A17/S4,A18/S5,A19/S6:-higher order adress bus. these are multiplexed with status signal(HERE  THESE PINS ARE ONLY USED FOR ADRESS BUS AS DATA BUS BIT IS 16]
here {s} is status signal.
at particular instant of time it acess adresss bus(where at that time data is low).

pin 33:-MN/MX{MINI /MAX}: pROCESSER OPERATE IN SINGLE MODE THAT IS MIMIMUM MODE OF OPERATTION.
